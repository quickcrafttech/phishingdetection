# Web-based Platform for Phishing Email Detection using Machine Learning
## Description
 This research endeavors to contribute to the ongoing efforts in combating phishing by harnessing the power of ML algorithms to classify phishing emails effectively. This project aims to develop a web-based application capable of discerning phishing emails from legitimate messages by leveraging cutting-edge technology and insights gleaned from recent phishing trends. The project is a Flask application that integrates an sklearn model for classifying phishing/spam emails. It provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the model.

## Prerequisites
* **Python 3.10 or above**: Ensure you have Python version 3.10 or later installed on your system. You can check the version by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you need to install Python, download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Getting Started
There are two ways to set up this project on your local environment:

1. **Using Git**
    a. Install Git if you haven't already: https://git-scm.com/downloads
    b. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired project directory.
    c. Clone this repository using the following command:

    Bash
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/quickcrafttech/phishingdetection.git
    ```

2. **Downloading the ZIP file**
    a. Visit your GitHub repository and navigate to the "Code" section.
    b. Click the "Download ZIP" button.
    c. Extract the downloaded ZIP file into your desired project directory.

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have the project files, install the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using pip:

Bash
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal/command prompt.

Run the following command to start the Flask application:

Bash
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or localhost:5000).

The application should now be running, and you can interact with it through the web interface!
